      <description>A few days ago, I was reading about the Kubernetes network model, especially about services and the kube-proxy component, and I discovered that kube-proxy has three modes, which are userspace, iptables and ipvs.
The userspace mode is too old and slow, nowaday nobody recommends to use it, the iptables mode is the default mode for kube-proxy with this mode kube-proxy use iptables rules to forward packets that are destined for services to a backend for that services, and the last one is ipvs I did not know what it was so I read about it.</description>
