      <description>I’m writing this article because I recently did this exercise in HackerRank:
I don’t have a degree in computer science or similar (but i’m working as a software engineer the last 3 years) so I really don’t have a solid math knowledge and at first sight this exercise seems easy, right?
Most of you will think that it is, but to me it wasn’t. My first approach was to think in a logical solution (at least I’d like to think that it was), then I thinked that if i wanted to know if the kangaroos will ever land on the same location at the same time I would have to move the kangaroos until they were both on the same location</description>
