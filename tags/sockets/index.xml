      <description>I bet there have been many times that you were working on the terminal with multiple tabs and you launched an HTTP server, and then you forgot that the server was already being executed, and then you tried to relaunch it from another tab getting the known error:
go run main.go listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use This is because we cannot open a socket with the same source address and port by default in Linux and the vast majority of operating systems.</description>
